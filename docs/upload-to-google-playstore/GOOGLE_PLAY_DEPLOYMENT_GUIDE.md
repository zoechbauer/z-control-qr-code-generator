> **Use this guide every time you want to deploy to Google Play Store**  
> _Works for both first-time uploads and updates_

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Ionic app is ready and tested
- ‚úÖ All changes are committed to git
- ‚úÖ Google Play Developer account is set up
- ‚úÖ Android development environment is working
- ‚úÖ **Changelog** (`CHANGELOG.md`) is updated
- ‚úÖ **Version info** is updated in `src/environments/environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`
- ‚úÖ **Remove any debug keystore shortcuts** (see Step 0 below)

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Upload to Google Play Store

### **Step 0: Clean Debug Keystores (Important!)**

```powershell
# In project root: c:\SOURCE-ACTIVE\ionic\qr-code\
# Remove or rename any debug keystore shortcuts
ren "keystore - Verkn√ºpfung.lnk" "keystore-debug-backup.lnk"
```
**Why:** Prevents automatic debug signing and ensures proper release signing

---

### **Step 1: Create Upload Keystore (FIRST TIME ONLY!)**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do this ONLY ONCE per app - then reuse the same keystore for all future updates**

```powershell
# In project root: c:\SOURCE-ACTIVE\ionic\qr-code\
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

**You'll be prompted for:**
- Keystore password (save securely!)
- Key password (use same as keystore password)
- Your name, organization, city, country

**Then create `keystore.properties`:**

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD_HERE
keyPassword=YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD_HERE
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../../upload-keystore.jks
```

**CRITICAL:**
- Save your keystore password securely
- Backup your `upload-keystore.jks` file
- Never share or commit the `keystore.properties` file to git

---

### **Step 2: Prepare App for Release**

- Update version info in `src/environments/environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`
- Set `versionCode` and `versionName` in `android/app/build.gradle` (e.g., `versionCode 1`, `versionName "1.0"`)

---

```powershell
ionic build --prod
npx cap sync android
cd android
.\gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Expected:** `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message

---

### **Step 4: Locate and Upload App Bundle**

- Find your `.aab` file at:  
  `android\app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab`

---

---

### **Step 2: Build and Bundle the App**

```powershell
ionic build --prod
npx cap sync android

- Create a closed test track in Play Console.
- Add testers (can be same as internal test group).
- Upload your `.aab` file and release notes.
- Share the closed test link with testers.
- Wait for feedback and ensure all features work as expected.

## **Production Mode**
