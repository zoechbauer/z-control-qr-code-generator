**How:**
1. Go to **Testen und Veröffentlichen → Test → Geschlossener Test**.
2. Click **"Neuen geschlossenen Test erstellen"**.
3. Add your testers (can be the same as internal test).
4. Upload your app bundle (AAB).
5. Complete required fields (release notes, etc.).
6. Publish the closed test.
7. Send the closed test link to your testers.
8. Wait for feedback and ensure everything works as expected.

## 📝 Changelog & Tester Communication

### **How to Include a Changelog in Release Notes**
- Add a clear, concise list of changes, improvements, or fixes for each version in the “Versionshinweise” (release notes) field in the Play Console.
- Use bullet points or short sentences.

#### **Example Changelog:**
```
Version 1.1 – 15. Juli 2025

• Added info message: Emojis and some special characters cannot be converted to QR codes.
• Updated help page with new emoji info.
• Minor bug fixes and improvements.
```

### **How Testers Are Informed About New Versions**
- Google Play does **not** send automatic emails for new test versions.
- Testers will see the update in the Play Store as a regular app update.
- If auto-updates are enabled, the app may update automatically.
- **Best practice:** Inform testers manually about new versions and changes.

#### **Sample Message to Send to Testers:**
```
